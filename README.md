## What is Oxylabs
Oxylabs is a tech company providing tools and resources for web data harvesting.

Our Oxylabs team has decades of personal experience in web data harvesting and extraction industry â€“ we know what works best. Therefore, we provide you with tools and proxies that we ourselves would use. Our clients can access a pool of 2M+ data center proxies and a residential proxy pool with 30M+ residential IPs from more than 180 countries around the globe.

## How does it work

Data center proxies are private proxies that are not affiliated with an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Data center proxies come from a secondary corporation and provide you with entirely private IP authentication and a high level of anonymity. The main benefit that data center proxies offer is rapid response times. 
Our Lead Account Manager Nedas talks all about Data center proxies, and how Oxylabs can accommodate even the most diverse business requirements:
